## ISBN
The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique.
Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.
An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.
